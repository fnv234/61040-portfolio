# Assignment 1


## Domains
The ten domains I identified for this project are the following: 

1. Fitness tracking and (personal) optimization: I come from a competitive sports background and love exercise. I often go to the gym and like analyzing performance data to optimize my workouts.

2. City exploration and documentation: I love trying new neighborhoods, food spots, and hidden gems around Boston, but it's easy to miss things or fall into routines. I think having a city exploration app where you can unlock places, place stickers and photos on a pin for other areas you've visited, and more could be fun.

3. Visiting cafes (and other food places): I enjoy checking out new cafes and other food places I've seen online with friends. The challenge is deciding where to go as a group, since people have different tastes and budgets.

4. Writing poetry: I like expressing myself through poetry, but I don't always keep my writing organized, revisit/edit past work, or have inspiration for new poems often. I love seeing snippets or phrases to inspire my writing process, which I thought could be a good area to explore for this project.

5. Choosing unique date ideas/locations: For me, coming up with fun and meaningful date ideas can be surprisingly hard. Even in a city with supposedly many options, it's easy to fall into repetitive routines (like always going to dinner or coffee). I think it would be interesting to have a tool that can help generate and organize creative date ideas/locations to make planning feel more exciting.

6. Organizing and summarizing work items: I generate a lot of work at school and internships (projects, notes, tasks), but struggle to capture what I've accomplished in a form that's streamlined and very useful later for resumes or reviews. Being able to understand and succinctly explain work that you've done is also crucial in the workplace, which makes this domain relevant to everyone.

7. Finding good or niche picture spots: I love photography and exploring, but it's hard to know where the best aesthetic spots are, especially in a new city. Social media can help fill in some of the blanks, but some areas recommended solely by influencers can be underwhelming or overcrowded.

8. Drinking matcha: As someone who cannot drink coffee, I love matcha for its health benefits and its caffeine content. I like discovering high-quality cafes that serve it, but the quality varies widely and reviews don't always help.

9. Picking fulfilling classes: At MIT, there are so many good course options. I personally think balancing requirements, interest, and workload can be daunting sometimes, and it was especially this way in my earlier years at this school. Having a way to mitigate this stress would be useful.

10. Meal plans: I like to plan my meals and generally have a well-rounded diet. I also believe that sticking to healthy eating is easier when it feels fun, and I struggle to be consistent with meal planning unless I can make it more engaging.


### Most promising: 
From the ten domains, I selected three that I found to be the most promising to me:

1. **Drinking matcha**
- Reasoning: Being able to sort and pick good places for matcha has always been one of my key interests. However, the trial-and-error process that can arise from this can lead to disappointment or wasted money. Having a tool that filters for matcha quality and highly-rated reviews, among other things, could be useful for me personally as well as an ever-growing community of enthusiasts, especially if it has a well-designed interface with lots of cool features.

2. **Organizing and summarizing work items**
- Reasoning: To reiterate, I produce a lot of work across classes, internships, and projects, but when it comes time to update relevant information on my resume or condense this information well, I often forget the tiny details. General note-taking tools are a bit open-ended, and some project trackers may not include space for personal reflection. I think a system, especially some sort of gamified system, that helps me log accomplishments and produce usable summaries would make any future reviews less stressful and support my long-term career growth (as well as that of potential users).

3. **Finding good or niche picture spots**
- Reasoning: Being artsy in photography can be difficult if the right places aren't advertised well to the people looking for them, and especially for those searching for spaces beyond the obvious tourist attractions. Current resources like blogs or Instagram are fragmented and do not allow for me to filter by vibe or style, so an app for this would make it easier to discover unique spots and therefore appeal to hobbyists, tourists, and more.


## Problems with Selected Domains
1. **Drinking matcha**

- Choosing a high quality matcha place: Many cafes serve matcha, but quality varies (sweetness, grade, preparation, and more). Oftentimes, social media can overemphasize the quality or taste of the matcha which makes it hard to rely on these perspectives alone to find a genuinely good matcha place.

- Finding creative variations: It is hard to know exactly where to get interesting matcha flavor options (e.g., white peach mango matcha lattes with oat milk, sparkling matcha lemonades, etc.). Once again, social media may have some inspiration but these can be in multiple different, potentially disconnected sources.

- Tracking and ranking personal favorites: After trying different cafes, it's easy to forget which places had the best drinks, especially if you have to search through your phone for specific photos (which may be from different days or times) to remember them or do not have dedicated notes for ranking them. 

2. **Organizing and summarizing work items**

- Keeping track of accomplishments for reviews: Students and employees alike, including me, could forget smaller wins that are useful in advancing their career unless they log them consistently. This is a problem if some pertinent information is lost which could affect their likelihood of receiving a raise, job, etc.

- Consolidating across tools: Work gets scattered across Notion, Google Docs, Slack, and more, making summaries tedious. If there were one platform for all, it would be much simpler to consolidate this information for users.

- Turning raw notes into usable summaries: Even if notes exist, they're often unstructured and not review-ready. It would be helpful to be able to make professional reviews or outlines for these reviews from even miscellaneous information.

3. **Finding good or niche picture spots**

- Discovering aesthetic locations: When I'm in a new city, it's often hard to figure out where the most photogenic backdrops are. While some online resources may highlight a few obvious attractions, they may skip over the full range of unique spots. Relying on social media means sifting through scattered posts or reels, which can be time-consuming. Creating a better way to discover aesthetic locations would make exploration and photography feel more intentional and rewarding.

- Avoiding overcrowded "Instagram spots" if desired: Many popular photo spots become overcrowded once they gain traction on Instagram or TikTok. While some people may not mind the crowds, others (like me) find these types of locations less enjoyable for photos. Having a tool that surfaces less-crowded alternatives (or indicates peak crowding times for these Instagrammable locations) could help photographers choose places.

- Matching desired photo style with location: Different people want different vibes (street art vs. skyline vs. cozy cafe). It is currently hard to filter by personal or desired aesthetic, so finding the right sort of place per individual could be time intensive. Having an app to tag or categorize photo spots by style would make it easier to match a user to a location for the kind of photo they want to capture.


## Selected Problems
1. **Choosing a good matcha place or brand**

- This stands out because it's highly specific and underserved â€” Yelp or Google reviews don't focus on matcha in particular. A specialized solution would directly help enthusiasts like me, and could be widely used given the popularity of the drink itself. 

2. **Keeping track of accomplishments for work reviews**

- This is high-value because it solves a recurring professional pain point (internships, jobs, applications). It also has a clear audience and workflow impact, which makes it significant.

3. **Discovering aesthetic locations for photography**

- People love sharing unique pictures, especially on social media. Current tools (Instagram geotags, Google Maps) are not necessarily optimized for finding spots, and they're more about browsing or luck in stumbling across the best places.

### Excluded Problems:

- **Matcha variations & tracking favorites**: These are interesting but secondary compared to simply *finding a good place*. They could be added later as extra features once a solid review or discovery system exists.

- **Consolidating across tools**: This would require heavy integrations with APIs like Notion, Slack, or Google Docs. That is technically challenging and potentially outside scope for this project, even if it is a real pain point for users and people in general.

- **Turning raw notes into usable summaries**: Similarly, while converting unstructured notes into clean summaries is useful, many existing tools may already address this well (like Notion AI). I believe the challenge here is less about lack of tools and more about personal workflow discipline, which is why I did not choose this problem in particular.

- **Avoiding overcrowded spots**: Crowdedness is subjective and hard to measure accurately. It could depend on time of day, weather, or personal tolerance, so it's not a stable problem to design around for the purposes of this project.

- **Matching desired photo style with location**: This is compelling, but might be harder to implement from the get-go since "style" is a fuzzy and personal dimension. Without robust tagging or image recognition, it's more feasible as a filtering layer once a base dataset of locations exists. I think this could be a valuable added feature once the app, as intended, resolves the current selected problem.


## Stakeholders
1. **Choosing a good matcha place**

- Matcha enthusiasts (intended as the primary users): Want reliable/trustworthy quality recommendations that they can also share with others. These are people who actively seek high-quality matcha and care about differences in grade, preparation, and authenticity, and don't want to waste money on poor quality drinks. Solving this problem would save them time and frustration, while also letting them build social credibility by introducing friends to genuinely good places.

- Cafe owners: Gain visibility if their product is highlighted as authentic/good. If their shop is recognized as serving authentic or high-quality matcha, they could see a direct increase in foot traffic. This kind of business advantage matters especially for smaller or niche cafes that may not have the marketing budget to compete with big chains.

- Casual cafe-goers: Indirectly affected if a friend drags them to a matcha place. Even if they don't care as much about authenticity themselves, their experience is better if the place is genuinely good and not disappointing, making them indirect beneficiaries of a better recommendation system.

2. **Keeping track of accomplishments**

- Students and employees: Need to capture and later retrieve achievements. Solving this issue would let them capture accomplishments in the moment and later organize them. For example, in group settings, like project teams, being able to track individual contributions fairly is also valuable.

- Managers and professors: Benefit from structured summaries when reviewing or recommending. When evaluating people for promotions or grading, having structured accomplishment records makes their job easier and reduces bias. For managers, being able to showcase their team's wins clearly also reflects well on their leadership.

- Mentors or career advisors: Can provide more tailored guidance. They often want to help students/employees articulate their strengths but sometimes their advice is only as good as the information they're given. If accomplishments and work are tracked and organized by the students/employees, then mentors can provide more impactful guidance to their mentees.

3. **Discovering aesthetic locations**

- Photographers (hobbyists/enthusiasts/etc.): Need curated location suggestions. By eliminating the need to sift through blog posts or social media, solving this issue saves them time and allows them to focus on the creative side of photography.

- Social media users and influencers: Want content that stands out or is not overused. Being able to discover less obvious or niche locations gives them a competitive edge in a very saturated entertainment market.

- Local businesses and tourism boards: Benefit if their location gets tagged in photos. For them, solving this issue can help drive visitors to more diverse or lesser-known places like theirs, which is a way to spread economic benefits beyond just the most famous sites.
