# Assignment 1


## Domains
1. Fitness tracking: I come from a competitive sports background and love exercise. I often go to the gym and like analyzing performance data to optimize workouts.

2. City exploration: I love trying new neighborhoods, food spots, and hidden gems around Boston, but it’s easy to miss things or fall into routines.

3. Visiting cafes and other food places: I enjoy checking out new cafes with friends. The challenge is deciding where to go as a group, since people have different tastes and budgets.

4. Writing poetry: I like expressing myself through poetry, but I don’t always keep my writing organized or revisit/edit past work.

5. Taking vitamins or medicine / healthcare: Remembering to take supplements or medicine daily can be hard, especially when traveling or busy.

6. Organizing and summarizing work items: I generate a lot of work at school and internships (projects, notes, tasks), but struggle to capture what I’ve accomplished in a form that’s useful later for resumes or reviews.

7. Finding good picture spots: I love photography and exploring, but it’s hard to know where the best aesthetic spots are, especially in a new city.

8. Drinking matcha: I love matcha and like discovering high-quality cafes that serve it, but the quality varies widely and reviews don’t always help.

9. Picking classes: At MIT, there are so many good course options. Balancing requirements, interest, and workload can be overwhelming.

10. Gamified meal plans: Sticking to healthy eating is easier when it feels fun. Gamifying meal planning could make it engaging and social.

### Most promising: 

1. Drinking matcha
2. Organizing and summarizing work items
3. Finding good picture spots

## Problems with Selected Domains
1. Drinking matcha

- Choosing a good matcha place: Many cafes serve matcha, but quality varies (sweetness, grade, preparation). General reviews don’t capture this, so it’s trial-and-error.

- Finding creative variations: Hard to know where to get interesting options (e.g., matcha lattes with oat milk, sparkling matcha).

- Tracking personal favorites: After trying different cafes, it's easy to forget which places had the best drinks.

2. Organizing and summarizing work items

- Keeping track of accomplishments for reviews: Students/employees forget smaller wins unless they log them consistently.

- Consolidating across tools: Work gets scattered across Notion, Google Docs, Slack, etc., making summaries tedious.

- Turning raw notes into usable summaries: Even if notes exist, they’re often unstructured and not review-ready.

3. Finding good picture spots

- Discovering aesthetic locations: When in a new city, it’s hard to know where photogenic backdrops are.

- Avoiding overcrowded "Instagram spots" if desired: Popular photo places highly featured on social media may be too busy or overdone.

- Matching photo style with location: Different people want different vibes (street art vs. skyline vs. cozy cafe).


## Selected Problems
1. Choosing a good matcha place

- This stands out because it’s highly specific and underserved — Yelp/Google reviews don’t focus on matcha. A specialized solution would directly help enthusiasts like me.

2. Keeping track of accomplishments for reviews

- This is high-value because it solves a recurring professional pain point (internships, jobs, applications). It also has a clear audience and workflow impact.

3. Discovering aesthetic locations for photography

- People love sharing unique pictures, especially on social media. Current tools (Instagram geotags, Google Maps) aren’t optimized for finding spots — they’re more about browsing or luck.

### Excluded Problems:

- Matcha variations/tracking favorites: lower priority; could be features rather than standalone problems.

- Consolidation across tools: technically harder, might require deep integrations.

- Avoiding overcrowded spots: subjective and harder to measure reliably.

## Stakeholders
1. Choosing a good matcha place

- Matcha enthusiasts (primary users): Want reliable quality recommendations.

- Cafe owners: Gain visibility if their product is highlighted as authentic/good.

- Casual cafe-goers: Indirectly affected if a friend drags them to a matcha place.

2. Keeping track of accomplishments

- Students/employees: Need to capture and later retrieve achievements.

- Managers/professors: Benefit from structured summaries when reviewing or recommending.

- Future self: Uses stored information for resumes, apps, or reflection.

3. Discovering aesthetic locations

- Photographers (hobbyists/enthusiasts): Need curated location suggestions.

- Social media users/influencers: Want content that stands out or is not overused.

- Local businesses/tourism boards: Benefit if their location gets tagged in photos.

## Evidence
1. Choosing a good matcha place
[Finding good quality matcha](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1h5qfp1/recommendations_on_where_i_can_buy_good_quality/) --> Shows that people often turn to forums to ask where they can find high-quality matcha, which highlights how hard it is to judge quality from standard reviews.
[Matcha buying guide](https://healthyhappylife.com/matcha-green-tea-brand-reviews-buying/) --> A detailed review of matcha powders demonstrates how many factors (origin, grade, flavor, price) affect quality, and that specialized information is necessary for good decisions.
[Best matcha powder](https://www.foodandwine.com/best-matcha-powder-8695612) --> Mainstream food media provides curated lists, but they focus on products to buy online, not cafes to visit, leaving a gap for in-person cafe recommendations.

Key takeaway: There’s strong interest in quality evaluation, but most resources are for buying matcha powder, not finding good drinks locally (or at least not in one place). That suggests a niche where an app could provide unique value.

Comparables:

Yelp/Google Reviews - Widely used for cafes, but reviews are generic and rarely mention matcha-specific details (sweetness, grade).

Instagram food posts - Sometimes highlight drinks visually, but don’t reliably reflect taste or authenticity.

Tea blogs — Provide detailed matcha breakdowns, but focus on at-home brewing, not local cafes.

Limitations: No existing platform offers matcha-specific, structured reviews for in-person cafes, despite rising interest.

2. Keeping track of accomplishments
[Reddit career question - how people track accomplishments](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11cnnd0/how_do_you_guys_track_accomplishments/) --> Many professionals admit they forget to track their wins and seek advice on tools or methods, proving this is a widespread career challenge.
[Advice for creating accomplishment tracker](https://provansuccess.com/accomplishment-tracker/) --> Coaches explicitly recommend structured tracking to avoid scrambling at review time, validating that this is a known best practice.
[Indeed - how to track accomplishments guide](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-track-accomplishments) --> Career site guides workers on different ways to log achievements (journals, spreadsheets, etc.), but all methods require discipline and aren’t automated.

Key takeaway: People know they should track accomplishments, but common methods are either ad hoc or burdensome. There’s authentic demand for a lighter, structured tool.

Comparables

Notion/Evernote — Powerful note-taking apps, but too general-purpose and require users to design their own structure.

Google Docs/Sheets — Easy logging, but not integrated into workflows and lack automation.

Project management tools (Asana, Trello) — Track tasks, but not optimized for summarizing accomplishments for reviews or resumes.

Limitations: Existing tools are either too broad or too task-focused; none specialize in helping users turn daily work into review-ready summaries.

3. Discovering aesthetic locations
[Reddit post asking about photography spots in Boston](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/12ci519/photography_spots_in_boston/) --> Users actively ask communities for suggestions, showing unmet demand for centralized resources on photogenic spots.
[12 most photographic places in Boston](https://shannonshipman.com/the-12-most-photographic-places-in-boston/) --> Travel bloggers fill the gap by listing photo-worthy locations, but these are static and don’t let users search/filter by style.
[Top 15 most instagrammable places in Boston](https://www.meetboston.com/blog/post/top-15-instagrammable-locations-in-boston/) --> Tourism boards promote photogenic destinations, but they highlight the same few iconic spots, ignoring smaller hidden gems.

Key takeaway: Current resources are fragmented, static, and biased toward popular tourist locations. This leaves room for a dynamic, community-driven discovery tool tailored to photographers.

Comparables

Instagram geotags — Allow browsing photos by location, but discovery is limited and unstructured (no filtering by vibe, time of day, etc.).

Google Maps “Popular with photographers” tags — Helpful, but generic and often highlight tourist-heavy areas.

Trover (discontinued photo app) — Tried to crowdsource photo locations but shut down, suggesting execution challenges (though the demand still exists).

Limitationss: Current tools help browse photos, but not actively discover or filter for unique photography spots that fit a user’s aesthetic style.
